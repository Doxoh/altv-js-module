# Official clientside JavaScript runtime for alt:V

## To generate:  
`cmake . -BBUILD`  

## To build:  
`cmake --build BUILD`  
Built `altv-client-js.dll` is now inside `BUILD/Debug` (if build is successful)  

## To test:  
Get dev branch of alt:V client (download from https://altv.mp or change branch in `altv.cfg`)  
Place `altv-client-js.dll` into alt:V client folder (same folder as altv.exe and altv-client.dll)  
Set `debug: true` in `altv.cfg`
